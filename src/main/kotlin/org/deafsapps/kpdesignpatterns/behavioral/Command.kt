/**
 * Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information
 * about the request. This transformation let you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s
 * execution, and support undoable operations.
 *
 * Problem:
 *
 *
 * Solution:
 * Essentially, the Command Design Pattern is a way to separate the requester of an action (the client) from the object
 * that performs the action (the receiver). By encapsulating the request itself as an object, we can pass it around and
 * manipulate it as needed. This allows us to parameterize the request with different arguments, queue it up for later
 * execution, or even undo it if needed.
 * There are several components to the Command Design Pattern:
 * - Command interface: This is an interface that defines the common methods for all commands. It usually has a single
 * method called 'execute()' that performs the action.
 * - Command class: This is a class that implements the Command interface and defines the behavior of a specific command.
 * It contains a reference to the object that will perform the action.
 * - Invoker: This is a class that requests an action to be performed by a command. It doesn't know how the action will
 * be performed or who will perform it.
 * - Receiver: This is a class that performs the actual action. The command object sends the request to the receiver
 * object, which then performs the action.
 *
 * Android Example:
 * There's no common use-case for the Command design pattern in Android Development, but it looks as a sensible option
 * when implementing editors (text, images, etc.).
