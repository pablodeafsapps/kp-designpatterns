/**
 * State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It
 * appears as if the object changed its class.
 *
 * Problem:
 * The main idea is that, at any given moment, thereâ€™s a finite number of states which a program can be in. Within any
 * unique state, the program behaves differently, and the program can be switched from one state to another instantaneously.
 * However, depending on a current state, the program may or may not switch to certain other states. These switching
 * rules, called transitions, are also finite and predetermined.
 *
 * Solution:
 * The State pattern suggests that you create new classes for all possible states of an object and extract all
 * state-specific behaviors into these classes. Instead of implementing all behaviors on its own, the original object,
 * called context, stores a reference to one of the state objects that represents its current state, and delegates all
 * the state-related work to that object.
 * The main drawback of the following implementation is that inner context operations ('startPlayback()' for instance)
 * are public and, thus, accessible from anywhere.
 *
 * Android Example:
 * This design pattern may be used when building audio/video players. However, Android does include built-in solutions
 * which address its own lifecycle and particularities.
 * ViewModels may be associated with some kind of state (as in MVI), so this design pattern may be a good candidate for
 * it.
