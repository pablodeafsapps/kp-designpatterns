/**
 * Observer is a behavioral design pattern that let you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about
 * any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
 *
 * Problem:
 * Sometimes you want certain changes to get broadcast to several classes or entities without setting up any coupling or
 * holding strong references.
 *
 * Solution:
 * The Observer pattern suggests that you add a subscription mechanism to the publisher class so individual objects can
 * subscribe to or unsubscribe from a stream of events coming from that publisher.
 *
 * Android Example:
 * In current Android Development, the Observer design pattern is rather popular since it's when implementing MVVM. Either
 * LiveData or StateFlow are good examples of observers to get subscribed to.
