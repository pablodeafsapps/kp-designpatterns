/**
 * Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on
 * their classes.
 *
 * Problem:
 * If we need to create an object out of another one, we'll need to create a new object of the same class. Then we'll
 * have to go through all the fields of the original object and copy their values over to the new object. However, not
 * all objects can be copied that way because some of the objectâ€™s fields may be private and not visible from outside.
 *
 * Solution:
 * Simply delegate the "copy" operation to the object to be cloned.
 *
 * > [!IMPORTANT]
 * > This design pattern is less relevant in Kotlin since there are 'data class' entities which provide copies out of
 * the box.
