/**
 * Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other
 * complex set of classes.
 *
 * Problem:
 * Imagine that you must make your code work with a broad set of objects that belong to a sophisticated library or
 * framework. Ordinarily, youâ€™d need to initialize all of those objects, keep track of dependencies, execute methods in
 * the correct order, and so on. As a result, the business logic of your classes would become tightly coupled to the
 * implementation details of 3rd-party classes, making it hard to comprehend and maintain.
 *
 * Solution:
 * A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. A
 * facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes
 * only those features that clients really care about.
 *
 * Android Example:
 * Undoubtedly, use-cases are entities which make use of the Facade design pattern. Normally, the client (generally a
 * view-model) simply executes the use-case, with no insights about what's going on in it. Internally, use-cases may
 * use several repositories (subsystems) to orchestrate some logic, but that's irrelevant to the client, since it only
 * expects a result out of it.
