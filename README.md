# kp-designpatterns
This repository aims to be a place to explore and depict some examples to shed some light onto **Software Design Patterns**, as they were first presented in the book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://books.google.es/books/about/Design_Patterns.html?id=6oHuKQe3TjQC&redir_esc=y). 

It's worth mentioning that most of the explanations will focus on how specific design patterns can be applied to Android development.

Some of the literature, snippets, and reasoning are based on the website [Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns), from [Refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/).
